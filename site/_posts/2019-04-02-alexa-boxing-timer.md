# Alexa Boxing Round Timer

I've started diving into the fun and exciting world of building an Alexa app! I am personally a big fan of the platform, and I have one in each room of my house.

Recently I've added one in my gym to play my music while I workout. I also got my heavy bag back up after I knocked it out of the ceiling last week - whoops! - I would like to claim it was because I'm such a heavy hitter, but it was more along the lines of it being because it was held in my ceiling by a single hook. Physics took over and slowly wiggled it out until it fell down. C'est la vie.

You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

I'm currently reading this book as well. Check out the notes I've taken though.

# Notes
* There are two main tribes. The hackers and the suits. Don't trust the suits
* There was no longer tension between determinism and free will
* People would get kinder as machines got better
* 'How do you know your supposed experience of consciousness isn't an illusions? Consciousness is precisely the only thing that is still just as real, if it's an illusion'
* I'm a great believer in cognigive diversity
* All human minds I've gotten to know well, have turned out to be more amazing than I imagined at first
* TV and video games draw people into a zombie like trance, and kids especially get stuck in it. While VR is active
* You don't get it. People are only the sexual organs that help machines reproduce and improve
* We aren't as good as talking about haptics as we are about talking about colors, shapes, and sounds
* Whomever has the best computer cloud will watch everyone with superior intensity from on
* Input is more important than display. Your input in VR is you
* If you ask the subject to put on a VR headset and then implement a visually perceived third arm, in the same location the buzzing seems to be coming from then the haptic perception no longer feels as if it is coming out of thin air but instead the third arm
* This is how VR will be. Like all the media before it. Capable of amplifying the best and worst in people
* One of my hacker buddies dated a women who had achieved more orgasms from within lucid dreams than any other subject in the lab
* Maybe VR can give us a hint about what we should want in the future as technology ramps up and people gain more and more options. We can simulate living in a Jetsons world today, let's try and see if we really want it.
* Silicon valley is drowning in quantified self-help and productivity cults that are supposed to sculpt ones life into an ideal in every way.
* Reincarnation is the wave way of interpreting people, insted of the particle way
* What about the women? She'll remain unnamed, but her name wasn't remarkable anyway
* She was a sexual polaris. Head's always turning to follow her, the way the heads of kittens turn to track a dangling toy.
* The quality of the visual display on it's own, is not the most important part of the quality of the visual experience of VR. What's much  more important is the tracking
* One goal for VR is to make the illusion as convincing as possible
* One of the things I like best about the culture of VR is that many of the same users who are ready to accept the brags and the theatrics of other digital services at face value are curious, and even demanding, to see behind the curtain of VR
* Why should you be the CEO? You're kind of flaky.
* Does that mean VR should be established by direct connection to the brain in the future?
* Measurement is more important than display in VR
* I didn't always like who I was becomming
* Of all the virtual worlds I've worked on the surgical simulators were the most satisfying
* I could also see how high tech tools hypnotize military minds
* If a digitial network could be used to hide the truth, and do that efficiently right smack in the middle of torrents of information and openness, then why were we so sure that networks would serve the cause of truth overall
* We did file for the patents, but we includede the complete source code for everything in total detail, thus, nullifying trade secrets.
* The lack of the internet wasn't a techincal problem, but a political one
* It was common in the 1970's to hear assertions about how, if all people everywhere could only believe something all at once, anything could be changed
* Nobody is ready to accept that the perfect dream hasn't been articulated, and might never be
* If trolls lurk only on the occasional bridge, that changes the way you cross every bridge
* I used to ridicule AI when people used to talk about it as if it were a religion
* Some AI believers have become fanatics, unable to even ponder that another point of view could exist
* We screw up the feedback loop that lets us be good engineers when we treat machines as people
* When people get scared, they get narrow minded
* Doesn't the combination of supreme course ruling, together with new economy conventions mean that America has alredy declared algorithms to not only be people, but super human
* Everytime you believe in AI, you're reducing your belief in human agency and value
* If we don't build an improved UI to see the results of our analysis, how can we possibly know if a robot is conveying thet most useful results to us 
* If AI has become the new religion then we are about to encounter the new scholasticism
* this is the thing about master salesmen. THey ultimately fool themselves in order to fool others
* The weirdness of real reality was outrunning the weirdness of VR
* How could anyone ever accomodate living under surveilance, unless they also lived in denial
* If you pretend that what you can code reflects a complete understanding of what you can do, then you lose sight of the mystery at the edges of everything
* There is a vibe in the business world that is a faint echo of military culture. A leader is someone who can magically will events into being
* Manhattan is overrun by the same chain stores you find everywhere. It feels less exceptional than it used to.
* Silicon valley has changed most of all. We won. We told the world to change for our pleasure, and it did. 
* Kids all over the globe gavea their privacy over to us, and our algorithms now twitch their marionette strings
* My sense is that there has been a slight lessening of cognitive diversity, howerver.
* People always seem to want dystopian tech, because it looks so cool
* Just because it takes awhile to figure a technology out, that doesn't mean the world has rejected it

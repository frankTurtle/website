# Notes
* There are two main tribes. The hackers and the suits. Don't trust the suits
* There was no longer tension between determinism and free will
* People would get kinder as machines got better
* 'How do you know your supposed experience of consciousness isn't an illusions? Consciousness is precisely the only thing that is still just as real, if it's an illusion'
* I'm a great believer in cognigive diversity
* All human minds I've gotten to know well, have turned out to be more amazing than I imagined at first
* TV and video games draw people into a zombie like trance, and kids especially get stuck in it. While VR is active

# Notes
* There are two main tribes. The hackers and the suits. Don't trust the suits
* There was no longer tension between determinism and free will
* People would get kinder as machines got better
* 'How do you know your supposed experience of consciousness isn't an illusions? Consciousness is precisely the only thing that is still just as real, if it's an illusion'
* I'm a great believer in cognigive diversity
* All human minds I've gotten to know well, have turned out to be more amazing than I imagined at first
* TV and video games draw people into a zombie like trance, and kids especially get stuck in it. While VR is active
* You don't get it. People are only the sexual organs that help machines reproduce and improve
* We aren't as good as talking about haptics as we are about talking about colors, shapes, and sounds
* Whomever has the best computer cloud will watch everyone with superior intensity from on
* Input is more important than display. Your input in VR is you
* If you ask the subject to put on a VR headset and then implement a visually perceived third arm, in the same location the buzzing seems to be coming from then the haptic perception no longer feels as if it is coming out of thin air but instead the third arm
* This is how VR will be. Like all the media before it. Capable of amplifying the best and worst in people
* One of my hacker buddies dated a women who had achieved more orgasms from within lucid dreams than any other subject in the lab
* Maybe VR can give us a hint about what we should want in the future as technology ramps up and people gain more and more options. We can simulate living in a Jetsons world today, let's try and see if we really want it.
* Silicon valley is drowning in quantified self-help and productivity cults that are supposed to sculpt ones life into an ideal in every way.
* Reincarnation is the wave way of interpreting people, insted of the particle way
* What about the women? She'll remain unnamed, but her name wasn't remarkable anyway
* She was a sexual polaris. Head's always turning to follow her, the way the heads of kittens turn to track a dangling toy.
* The quality of the visual display on it's own, is not the most important part of the quality of the visual experience of VR. What's much  more important is the tracking

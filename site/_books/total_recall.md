In his signature larger-than-life style, Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Total Recall is a revealing self-portrait of his illustrious, controversial, and truly unique life.

The greatest immigrant success story of our time.

His story is unique, and uniquely entertaining, and he tells it brilliantly in these pages.

He was born in a year of famine, in a small Austrian town, the son of an austere police chief. He dreamed of moving to America to become a bodybuilding champion and a movie star.

By the age of twenty-one, he was living in Los Angeles and had been crowned Mr. Universe.

Within five years, he had learned English and become the greatest bodybuilder in the world.

Within ten years, he had earned his college degree and was a millionaire from his business enterprises in real estate, landscaping, and bodybuilding. He was also the winner of a Golden Globe Award for his debut as a dramatic actor in Stay Hungry.

Within twenty years, he was the world’s biggest movie star, the husband of Maria Shriver, and an emerging Republican leader who was part of the Kennedy family.

Thirty-six years after coming to America, the man once known by fellow body­builders as the Austrian Oak was elected governor of California, the seventh largest economy in the world.

He led the state through a budget crisis, natural disasters, and political turmoil, working across party lines for a better environment, election reforms, and bipartisan solutions.

With Maria Shriver, he raised four fantastic children. In the wake of a scandal he brought upon himself, he tried to keep his family together.

Until now, he has never told the full story of his life, in his own voice.

Here is Arnold, with total recall.

# What I liked
* What can I say, I am a huge fan of Arnold
* Not only his fitness side, which I am probably the biggest fan of, but his public service was something I was not too familiar with
* I really enjoyed learning about how his early life and upbringing was - what his motivations and thoughts were for becoming a bodybuilder
* I've only fairly recently gotten real interested in bodybuilding as a sport and adjusted my training style to match more of that
* I very much enjoyed the mental aspect of how he approached everything. All of the phychological tricks and concepts that he employed throughtout his career. Not only bodybuilding, but his political and personal life as well

# What I did not like so much
* I know it was about his entire life, but I could've done with a lot less of the movie stuff - I was just not too personally interested in that part of his life

# Takeaway
* I will probably re-read the bodybuilding parts because that is what I am most interested in 

# Notes
* The idea of balancing the body and the mind, was like a religion for him
* You have to build the ultimate physical machine, but also the mind
* Soon life at the gym totally consumed me. Training was all I could think about. One Sunday when I found the statium locked, I broke in and worked out in the freezing cold. I had to wrap my hands in towels to keep them from sticking to the metal bars.
* The audience gave me strength and motivation and my ego kicked in more. I discoved that I performed much much better in front of others
* Being in front of customers meant I could not workout my usual four to five hours sessions per day. So I adopted the idea of training twice a day. Two hours before work, and two hours from seven to nine in the evening.
* Split workouts seemed like an annoyance at first, but I realized I was onto something when I saw the results
* By showtime, word had gotten around that this monster teenager had shown up from out of knowwhere, with an unpronouncable name, and he was a goddamned giant
* What if I had gone to London intending to win? Would I have prepared better? Would I have performed better? Would I have won, and now be Mister Universe? Instead, I had underestimated my chances. I didn't like the way this made me feel. It really taught me a lesson. After that, I never went to a competition to compete. I went to win.
* Downhill skiiers and Formula1 race car drivers know they can be killed. But they compete anyway.
* Until then, I thought that only girls cried. I ended up crying quietly in the dark for hours. It was a great relief. 
* At the Mr. Olympia level, what is most important, is not necessarily what goes on in the middle of a pose. The judges assume you know how to do that. What becomes crucial is what you do between one pose and the next. How do the hands move? How does the face look? What is the posture? It's like in ballet. It's all about the straightness of the back. The head up, not down. Never, ever, take an extra step. 
* Often it's easier to make a decision when you don't know as much, because then you can't overthink. If you know too much, it can freeze you

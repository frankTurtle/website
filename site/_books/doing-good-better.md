While a researcher at Oxford, William MacAskill decided to devote his study to a simple question: How can we do good better? MacAskill realized that, while most of us want to make a difference, we often decide how to do so based on assumptions and emotions rather than facts. As a result, our good intentions often lead to ineffective, sometimes downright harmful, outcomes.
            
As an antidote, MacAskill and his colleagues developed effective altruism—a practical, data-driven approach to doing good that allows us to make a tremendous difference regardless of our resources. Effective altruists operate by asking certain key questions that force them to think differently, set aside biases, and use evidence and careful reasoning rather than act on impulse. In Doing Good Better, MacAskill lays out these principles and shows that, when we use them correctly—when we apply the head and the heart to each of our altruistic endeavors—each of us has the power to do an astonishing amount of good.

# What I liked
* It provided me with a great introduction to effective altrusism
* I have recently been getting into how I can use my skills to better the lives of others less fortunate than myself. This book did a lot of the initial heavy lifting
* The statistics, although a few years outdated at this point, were pretty interesting to me
* I am part of the global 1%
* I am well above the average us salary of $46,800
* There are more than one avenue to help contribute to altruistic endeavors
    * I used to think that you either worked for a non-profit, or you donated money
    * I did not realize there were other ways that I could proactively approach it and still make a difference
* There are significantly more effective ways to help, and there are good ways to help
    * It's similiar to the start-up community in my mind
    * The VC's are looking for companies that will return 1000x their investment
    * The same things is true while looking into charities - Some of them just do **more** good than others

# What I did not like so much
* There was literally nothing I did not like about this book

# Takeaway
* I have only just begun my journey into helping, this book and the [80,000 hours](https://80000hours.org) organization have helped start me on my journey
* It was very interesting hearing about how organizations use metrics to measure impact
* I have begun doing some research into what I can do to make a difference
* I want to do my part to help facilitate this world into a global civilization

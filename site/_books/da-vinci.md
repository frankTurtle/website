The #1 New York Times bestseller

“A powerful story of an exhilarating mind and life...a study in creativity: how to define it, how to achieve it.” —The New Yorker

“Vigorous, insightful.” —The Washington Post

“A masterpiece.” —San Francisco Chronicle

“Luminous.” —The Daily Beast

He was history’s most creative genius. What secrets can he teach us?

The author of the acclaimed bestsellers Steve Jobs, Einstein, and Benjamin Franklin brings Leonardo da Vinci to life in this exciting new biography.

Based on thousands of pages from Leonardo’s astonishing notebooks and new discoveries about his life and work, Walter Isaacson weaves a narrative that connects his art to his science. He shows how Leonardo’s genius was based on skills we can improve in ourselves, such as passionate curiosity, careful observation, and an imagination so playful that it flirted with fantasy.

He produced the two most famous paintings in history, The Last Supper and the Mona Lisa. But in his own mind, he was just as much a man of science and technology. With a passion that sometimes became obsessive, he pursued innovative studies of anatomy, fossils, birds, the heart, flying machines, botany, geology, and weaponry. His ability to stand at the crossroads of the humanities and the sciences, made iconic by his drawing of Vitruvian Man, made him history’s most creative genius.

His creativity, like that of other great innovators, came from having wide-ranging passions. He peeled flesh off the faces of cadavers, drew the muscles that move the lips, and then painted history’s most memorable smile. He explored the math of optics, showed how light rays strike the cornea, and produced illusions of changing perspectives in The Last Supper. Isaacson also describes how Leonardo’s lifelong enthusiasm for staging theatrical productions informed his paintings and inventions.

Leonardo’s delight at combining diverse passions remains the ultimate recipe for creativity. So, too, does his ease at being a bit of a misfit: illegitimate, gay, vegetarian, left-handed, easily distracted, and at times heretical. His life should remind us of the importance of instilling, both in ourselves and our children, not just received knowledge but a willingness to question it—to be imaginative and, like talented misfits and rebels in any era, to think different.

I am currently re-reading this, so I'll update once I finish it again.

# What I liked
* Da Vinci loved animals so much he would purchase birds from vendors then set them free immediately

# What I did not like so much

# Takeaway

# Notes
* He had an imagination so excitable, that it floated with the edges of fantasy
* His notebooks are the greatest record of curiosity ever created
* Above all, Leonardos relentless curiosity and experimentation should remind us of the importance of instilling, in both ourselves and our children, not just received knowledge but a willingness to question it
* His lack of reverence of authority and his willingness to challege received wisdom would lead him to craft an empirical approach to understanding nature that foreshadowed the scientific method, developed more than a century later by Bacon
* Intellectual passino drives out sensuality
* Leonardos only formal learning was at an abbacus school
* Being left handed also affected Leonardos method of drawing - As with his writing he would draw from right to left so as to not smudge it with his hand
* The glory of being an artist he realized, was that reality should inform but not constrain
* He knew there was always more that he might learn. More teqhniques he might master and further inspirations that might strike him
* Motions and postures of figures should display the true mental state of the originator of these motions
* The joy of these juxtapositions They allow us to marvel at the beauty of a universal mind
* He would walk the streets with a notebook dangling from his belt, find a group of people with exaggerated features who would make good models, and invite them over for supper
* The relationship between the microcosm of man and the macrocosm of the earth
* Throughout his life he would repeat this claim that he would prefer experience over received scholarship
* While Europe was mired in it's dark years of medieval superstition, the work of combining theory and experiment was advanced primarily in the Islamic world
* Like much with Leonardo these were interconnected - Any person who puts "Describe the tongue of the woodpecker" on his to-do list, is overendowed with the combination of curiosity and acquity. 
* He was aided by the sharpness of his eye. Which focused on things the rest of us glance over 
* The acuteness of his observational skills was not some super power he posessed, instead, it was a product of his own efforts. That's important. Because it means we can, if we wish, not just marvel at him, but try to learn from him by pushing ourselves to look at things more curiously and intensely

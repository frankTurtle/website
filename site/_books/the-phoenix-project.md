Bill is an IT manager at Parts Unlimited. It's Tuesday morning and on his drive into the office, Bill gets a call from the CEO. 

The company's new IT initiative, code named Phoenix Project, is critical to the future of Parts Unlimited, but the project is massively over budget and very late. The CEO wants Bill to report directly to him and fix the mess in ninety days or else Bill's entire department will be outsourced. 

With the help of a prospective board member and his mysterious philosophy of The Three Ways, Bill starts to see that IT work has more in common with manufacturing plant work than he ever imagined. With the clock ticking, Bill must organize work flow streamline interdepartmental communications, and effectively serve the other business functions at Parts Unlimited. 

In a fast-paced and entertaining style, three luminaries of the DevOps movement deliver a story that anyone who works in IT will recognize. Readers will not only learn how to improve their own IT organizations, they'll never view IT the same way again.

I'll be honest, I forgot to write a review of this when I finished it, so I do not remember too much about liked / disliked. 

# What I liked
* It was a great and concrete introduction for me to DevOps
* I had a general idea of how and why DevOps was needed, but not as indepth of an explanation as this provided
* I found a lot of it incredibly relatable as I used to be in IT, and now I'm a software engineer - Which, I suppose is technically IT still
* I enjoyed all of the characters within the organization - I cannot even remember the name of the company ... - and I could pinpoint some people who were essentially clones
* I found the thoughts and the insights into the reasoning behind it all very interesting
* It provided me a way to view the infrastructure as a whole that I had not necessarily thought about before
* It was actually incredibly fascinating to think about the entire procedure as a whole
* I have some experience with thinking about the bigger picture - from more of an architectural point of view. From CI and Jenkins build / deploy procedures I've implemented on projects
* The over-importance of a single point of failure person was very interesting

# What I did not like so much
* Initially it was a little rough around the edges for me
* I did not realize that it was building a story around the need and want for the evolution of the DevOps mindset
* I remember thinking it was incredibly slow
* I also didn't realize that it was written as a narrative and not a how-to guide - That's on me though!

# Takeaway
* I would highly recommend it for anyone in the IT world - Even not just IT. The thoughts and decisions implemented carry over into several disciplines
* I will probably read it again, and skip the intro nonsense

# Notes
* Nothing of note
